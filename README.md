## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script file `time_difference_calculator.py`.

2. Create a text file named `dates.txt` in the same directory as the script. This file should contain two lines with datetime values in the following format:

```2023-09-12 10:00:00.000000
2023-09-12 15:30:45.123456
```

Replace the values with your desired start and end datetime.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and `dates.txt`.

4. Run the script using the following command:

`python time_difference_calculator.py`

5. The script will display the time difference in seconds, minutes, and hours based on the datetime values in `dates.txt`.

## Usage

To use the Time Difference Calculator, follow the steps outlined in the "Getting Started" section. Customize the `dates.txt` file with your specific datetime values. The script will calculate and display the time difference in various units.

## Example

For example, if `dates.txt` contains the following values:

2023-09-12 10:00:00.000000
2023-09-12 15:30:45.123456

Running the script will produce the following output:
```
For time between 2023-09-12 10:00:00.000000 and 2023-09-12 15:30:45.123456
Time difference in seconds: 19845.123456 seconds
Time difference in minutes: 330.7520576 minutes
Time difference in hours: 5.512534293333333 hours
```
